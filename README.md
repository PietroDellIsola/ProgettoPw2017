# ProgettoPw2017
It's a simple e-commerce for the exam "PROGRAMMAZIONE WEB", developed by my friends and me 

How to work:
1)Making the pull of the project
2)Import the database from the folder "databaseProgetto" in your RDBMS.
3)Run and deploy the project on your Server (I used "apache-tomcat-9.0.21").
4)Enjoy!
